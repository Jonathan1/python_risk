# Notes & Progress
Questions to look into:
- Are turns objects?
- How does the turn sequence / looper look like?
- Should a unit know which player is its owner?
    maybe, because otherwise it will be hard to know where a unit can move or attack
- Should a region know which player is its owner?
    maybe, because otherwise, how do you check where a unit can be placed?
- OR MAYBE, for the above questions: this is something the loop sequence decides?
- Should a region know its Continent? -> no
